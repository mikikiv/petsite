# Before you go!

## After your stay

### Guest Room

Generally, the bed in the guest room is folded back up to couch mode. Unless you hear otherwise from us, there is no need to make up the bed after your stay. 

### Gate

Make sure the hallway gate is closed and that the dogs are on the kitchen side of the gate so they aren't roaming the hallway and bathroom.
