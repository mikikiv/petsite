# Before you go!

## After your stay

### Guest Room

Unless you hear otherwise from us, there is no need to make up the bed after your stay. We will wash the sheets and put them whereever they should be.

### Gate

Make sure the laundry room gate is closed and that the dogs can't access the litter box.
