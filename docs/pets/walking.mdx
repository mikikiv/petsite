# Walking

Both dogs enjoy walking a ton. It doesn't take a ton of work to get them the energy they have out.

## Harnesses

* Olympia = Blue Harness
* CJ      = Red Harness (Also has waste bags attached to it)

Theres a loop in the front and back of the neck. We like to hook the leashes up to each dogs chest loop.

## Leashes

We have a double leash that makes it easy to walk two dogs at once. Its black, and has a squishy handle. Hook this up to each dog's harness to keep them together nicely. Otherwise, the black lease with two handles is best for CJ while the purple leash (also a waste belt) is best for Olympia.
