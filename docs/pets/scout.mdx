# Scout

Scout is our little princess cat. She is pretty social, but usually shy around dogs, especially around dogs that she doesn't live with. 

:::important Scout is 100% an indoor cat

When the weather is nice, and given the opportunity, she will sneak out of the back door and either eat grass. Please don't leave her outside. She doesn't know how to fend for herself

## Litterbox

Scout's litterbox is in the small cupboard near the front door.
Use the littergenie to dispose of her poops, or a trashbag. She will poop on the carpet if theres too much poop in the litterbox, and then she will blame the dogs for it. And then the dogs will clean it up for her. Just all bad things...

## Routine

Most days Scoutie just lays around in her favorite spots and eats. She will bug you if she is hungry and she bites if she gets too many pets. 

### Lounging

Most of the time, she is found in her cat tree, or in the dining room, near to her food. 

### Avoiding confrontation

CJ, being his protective self, loves to keep Scoutie under control by breathing on her. Sometimes it's a bit much. Just ask him to stop if he's being mean. Scout will only come to really hang out on you if the dogs aren't able to, or if she's hungry and her food is empty
