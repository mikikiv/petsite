# Scout

Scout is our little princess cat. She is pretty social, but usually shy around dogs, especially around dogs that she doesn't live with.

:::important Scout is 100% an indoor cat

When the weather is nice, and given the opportunity, she will sneak out of the back door and either eat grass. Please don't leave her outside. She doesn't know how to fend for herself

## Litterbox

Scout's litterbox is in the small cupboard near the garage.
Use the litter-genie to dispose of her poops, or a trashbag. She will poop on the carpet if theres too much poop in the litterbox, and then she will blame the dogs for it. And then the dogs will clean it up for her. Just all bad things...

## Routine

Most days Scoutie just lays around in her favorite spots and eats. She will bug you if she is hungry and she bites if she gets too many pets.

### Lounging

Most of the time, she is found in her cat tree, or in the dining room, near to her food.

## Hiding places

There are a few common spots where you might find scout if she is "missing" in order of likelihood:

- In a chair under the dining table
- In an office chair
- Family Room in front of the sliding door
- Guest room bed
- At the top of her cat tower
- Office hammock
- In the garage (if she has had the opportunity to sneak in there)
- Middle bathroom bathtub
- Under master bedroom bed
- Under the truck (side backyard if she got out there)
