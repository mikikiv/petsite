# Scout

Scout is our little princess cat. She is very social, but very shy around dogs, especially around dogs that she doesn't live with. 

:::important Scout is 100% an indoor cat

When the weather is nice, and given the opportunity, she will sneak out of the back screen door and either eat grass under the kitchen window, or hide in the shed. Please don't leave her outside. She doesn't know how to fend for herself

## Litterbox

Scout's litterbox is in the bathroom, in a cupboard across from the shower. The cupboard door should always remain open, the bathroom door should stay open whenever its not in use. 

Use the littergenie to dispose of her poops, or a trashbag.

## Routine

Most days Scoutie just lays around in her favorite spots and eats. Expect her to attempt to join you in the bathroom whenever possible.

:point_up: Scout will usually visit the bathroom with you and eat, or just stand around with you

### Lounging

Most of the time, she is found in her cat tree in the kitchen, or the guest room bed

### Avoiding confrontation

CJ, being his protective self, loves to keep Scoutie under control by breathing on her. Sometimes it's a bit much. Just ask him to stop if he's being mean. Scout will only come to really hang out on you if the dogs aren't able to, or if she's hungry and her food is empty
