:::tip
Our dogs are notorious for not eating or finishing their meals at the expected times. They may eat less than expected while their parents are out of home.

## Medicine

Various issues come up on various occassions

### CJ's Old Man treats

:::note Dynomax

One treat per day is for helping keep CJ feel young. Split a treat in half so that he actually eats them. Routinely, we give them to him in the afternoon but anytime once per day is ok

:::

### Ear Stuff

:::note Dynomax

If the dogs are needing their ears cleaned because they keep trying to fly away. Not typical that you'll need to use this.

:::

### Heartworm medicine

:::note Heartguard

On the 2nd of every month, we have an Alexa alarm reminding us to give the dogs medicine. Heartguard is in their snackbar thing. If you give this to them, mark it off. Don't feel bad if you miss it, we will catch it!
