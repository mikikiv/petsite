:::tip 
Our dogs are notorious for not eating or finishing their meals at the expected times. They may eat less than expected while their parents are out of home.

## Medicine
Various issues come up on various occassions

One treat per day is for helping keep CJ feel young. Split a treat in half so that he actually eats them. Routinely, we give them to him in the afternoon but anytime once per day is ok
