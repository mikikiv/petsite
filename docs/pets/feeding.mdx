### Heartworm medicine

:::note Heartguard

On the 2nd of every month, we have an Alexa alarm reminding us to give the dogs medicine. Heartguard is in their snackbar thing. If you give this to them, mark it off. Don't feel bad if you miss it, we will catch it!

:::note Bravecto

This is flea medicine. Both dogs get it when it comes in through Chewy. It's an easy chewable treat. Just make sure each dog gets the right dosage size. None for Scoutie at this time.
