# CJ

CJ was born July 20 2011 and been a part of Tayler's family since birth. His parents, Chato and Molia, were part of Tayler's grandparents family and also gave CJ two brothers and a sister who stayed in the family, and 5 others that went to other families.

:::important CJ is over 10 years old

While his hips are in decent shape, his back is noticably an area of discomfort for him. Avoid situations where dogs attempt to mount him which hurts his back and can make CJ very upset.

## Barking

### Backyard
We do not let CJ outside at the same time as Olympia because they are much harder to control while both outside, especially when they getting into barking fights with the neighbor dogs.

CJ has two primary types of barking habits in the backyard. 
1. The one where he barks at the neighbor dogs and sounds scary. The neighbor dogs bark back but it's hard to reel CJ back in sometimes when he gets in this position.
2. The other is his bark to tell the neighborhood he is outside. He usually does that from the concrete slab out the backdoor. He doesn't mean too much harm by it but it can get the neighbor dogs up and start barking back.

### Inside
CJ is actually really good about not looking for things to bark at while inside. He will begin barking when someone knocks at the door and can look very agressive to anyone who is at the door. He also barks when Olympia begins any sort of barking noises. Even if Olympia isn't barking at anything
