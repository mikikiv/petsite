## Barking

### Backyard
<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> We do not let CJ outside at the same time as Olympia unnattended because they are much harder to control while both outside, especially when they getting into barking fights with the neighbor dogs.

CJ has two primary types of barking habits in the backyard. 
1. The one where he barks at the neighbor dogs and sounds scary. 
2. The other is to bark into the wind; letting everyone know he's awake. He's just weird.

### Inside
CJ is actually really good about not looking for things to bark at while inside. He will begin barking when someone knocks at the door and can look very agressive to anyone who is at the door. He also barks when Olympia begins any sort of barking noises. Even if Olympia isn't barking at anything
