# CJ

CJ was born July 20 2011 and been a part of Tayler's family since birth. He is a senior dog with a weak bladder, poor hearing, and smelly farts. 

## Key things
- Going potty
  - If CJ's tail raises, he is getting ready to go potty; inside or outside, pee or poop!
  - Many times a day CJ needs to go pee. On routine, he will go out in the morning, after breakfast, after lunch, before and after dinner, and before bed.
  - As soon as you get home, CJ will need to go pee. He should also go pee before you leave.
  - Leave him outside for a few minutes to ensure he has time to decide to go poop. He will come inside and poop without warning.
- Food
  - CJ will eat Olympia's food if she hasn't started eating. Make sure he doesn't eat her food

:::important CJ is a senior

While his hips are in decent shape, his back is noticably an area of discomfort for him. Avoid situations where dogs attempt to mount him which hurts his back and can make CJ very upset.

:::

We have experienced a few incidents with CJ during a strenous activity where he sat or laid down and yelped very loudly for about a minute. It usually starts with him raising a paw and then laying down. Shouldn't have to worry about this unless you're going on a hike or to the beach. 

## Favorite things
- Walks
- Treats
- Sniffs
- Following his humans

## Barking

### Backyard
<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> 
CJ will often bark into the wind; letting everyone know he's awake. This will cause the neighbors dog to bark but he doesn't appear to notice unless Olympia is barking too.

### Inside
CJ is actually really good about not looking for things to bark at while inside. He will begin barking when someone knocks at the door and can look very agressive to anyone who is at the door. He also barks when Olympia begins any sort of barking noises. Even if Olympia isn't barking at anything
