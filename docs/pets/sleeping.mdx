# Nighttime with the pets


## Dogs
Dogs should prefer to sleep in the master bedroom. They know its not playtime in there at least. Feel free to put a gate in front of the doorway if you want to lock them up. They don't mind. There is a water bowl (that probably needs filling) in the master bathroom for them.

:::note 
It could be beneficial to turn on the sound machine (white capsuly thing next to the bed) in the bedroom so they sleep better

## Scout

We suspect that Scoutie attempts to sleep with our guests when we aren't home. We aren't really sure where she sleeps these days overnight. Let us know!
