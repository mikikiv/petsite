# Nighttime with the pets

## Dogs

Olympia will probably sleep in bed with you if you let her. Whatever you are comfortable with she will respect.

:::note
It could be beneficial to turn on the sound machine (white capsuly thing next to the bed) in the bedroom so they sleep better

## Scout

We suspect that Scoutie attempts to sleep with our guests too when we aren't home. We aren't really sure where she sleeps these days overnight. Let us know!
