# Food and Medicine

Each pet requires **food/water**. Feeding is easy!

## Medicine

Various issues come up on various occasions. Carprofen and Dynomax on a daily basis. Heartguard on the 2nd of every month. Bravecto every 12 weeks. All details below

### CJ's Old Man treats

:::note Dynomax

One treat per day is for helping keep CJ feel young. Split a treat in half so that he actually eats them. Routinely, we give them to him in the afternoon but anytime once per day is ok

:::

:::note Carprofen

This is kind of a pain medicine. Helps CJ stay healthy/active. 100mg (or 1 pill) per meal.

:::

### Heartworm medicine

:::note Heartguard

On the 2nd of every month, we have an Alexa alarm reminding us to give the dogs medicine. Heartguard is in their snackbar thing. If you give this to them, mark it off. Don't feel bad if you miss it, we will catch it!

:::

:::note Bravecto

This is flea medicine. Both dogs get it when it comes in through Chewy. It's an easy chewable treat. Just make sure each dog gets the right dosage size. None for Scoutie at this time.
