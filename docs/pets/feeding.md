:::tip
Our dogs are notorious for not eating or finishing their meals at the expected times. They may eat less than expected while their parents are out of home.
Add some Stella powder to make it more appealing to them

## Medicine

Various issues come up on various occassions. Carprofen and Dynomax on a daily basis. Heartguard on the 2nd of every month. Bravecto every 12 weeks. All details below

### CJ's Old Man treats

:::note Dasuquin

One treat per day is for helping keep CJ feel young. Split a treat in half so that he actually eats them. Routinely, we give them to him in the afternoon but anytime once per day is ok

:::

:::note Carprofen

This is kind of a pain medicine. Helps CJ stay healthy/active. 50mg per meal, so 100mg per day.

### Heartworm medicine

:::note Heartguard

On the 2nd of every month, we have an Alexa alarm reminding us to give the dogs medicine. Heartguard is in their snackbar thing. If you give this to them, mark it off. Don't feel bad if you miss it, we will catch it!

:::

:::note Bravecto

This is flea medicine. Both dogs get it when it comes in through Chewy. It's an easy chewable treat. Just make sure each dog gets the right dosage size. None for Scoutie at this time.
