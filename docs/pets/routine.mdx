# Routine

## Daytime

Typical schedule for the dogs at our house (but is by no means a hard schedule):

- Bathroom at 8am, 12pm, 5pm, and 8pm.
- Party between 5pm and 8pm. Sleep the rest of the time

## Walking

Olympias harness is black. We usually have an e-collar on her too for keeping her attention. No need to use it if you're not comfortable with it.
When she knows your intention is to walk, she gets excited but doesn't want you to put the harness over her head. She still wants to walk! She usually wants to go into the backyard to pee immediately after a walk if she didn't go while out.

She always will stare at other dogs when she sees them until they bark. The e-collar has a beep that works well to get her back on track. 


## In Public

Olympia is very capable of going out in public. She is pretty well behaved but will definitely always stare at other dogs and contribute to bark-offs
