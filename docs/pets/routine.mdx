# Routine

Typical schedule for the dogs at our house: Bathroom at 8, 12, 5, and 8. Party between 5 and 8. Sleep the rest of the time


# Walking
## Together
CJ is protective of his family. He has bitten people that have _not_ greeted us while they walk past. Not often, and not hard, but its scary enough.
Together, they are both ready to fight other dogs (mostly Olympia but she will get CJ involved) and chase any cats. 

Theres a loop in the front and back of the neck of their harness. We like to hook the leashes up to each dogs chest loop.

:::info Leashes
We have a double leash that makes it easy to walk two dogs at once. Its black, and has a squishy handle. Hook this up to each dog's harness to keep them together nicely. Otherwise, the black lease with two handles is best for CJ while the purple leash (also a waste belt) is best for Olympia.

### CJ
CJ gets the red harness, and black leash (if not using the double lease).
When he knows your intention is to walk him he gets a little crazy.
Great to walk on his own. He's so friendly and looooooves sniffing things

### Olympia
Olympias harness is Turquoise. We usually have an e-collar on her too for keeping her attention. No need to use it if you're not comfortable with it.
When she knows your intention is to walk, she gets excited but doesn't want you to put the harness over her head. She still wants to walk!
