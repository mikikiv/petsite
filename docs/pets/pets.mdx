      Our little monster was born September 2018. She makes funny sounds and can
      have a ton of energy. We know that she is just the perfect little dog.
      Just over 45 pounds of pure muscle, don't let her crash into your legs at
      top speed. And watch for her jumping up to lick your face!

      Scout was born in 2016 in a truck yard in Southern California. She came to
      our family as a tiny tiny cat and always ruled the house, until CJ came
      along. She's social and curious, but has entirely a type-A personality.
      Belly rubs are requested, she rewards belly rubs with scratches and
      friendly bites.
