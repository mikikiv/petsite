  children="Our little monster was born September 2018. She makes funny sounds and
  can have a ton of energy. We know that she is just the perfect little
  dog. Just over 40 pounds of pure muscle, don't let her crash into your
  legs at top speed. And watch for her jumping up to lick your face!" />

  Scout was born in 2016 in a truck yard in Southern California. She came
  to our family as a tiny tiny cat and always ruled the house, until CJ
  came along. She's social and curious, but has entirely a type-A
  personality. Belly rubs are requested, she rewards belly rubs with
  scratches and friendly bites.
