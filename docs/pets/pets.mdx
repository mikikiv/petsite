    Our little monster was born September 2018. She makes funny sounds and can
    have a ton of energy. We know that she is just the perfect little dog. Just
    over 45 pounds of pure muscle, don't let her crash into your legs at top
    speed. And watch for her jumping up to lick your face!

    Scout was born in 2016 in a truck yard in Southern California. She came to
    our family as a tiny tiny cat and always ruled the house, until CJ came
    along. She's social and curious, but has entirely a type-A personality.
    Belly rubs are requested, she rewards belly rubs with scratches and friendly
    bites.
