# Kitchen

### Whats in the fridge
Honestly, probably not much. With the sole exception of the last servings of cereal and milk, whatever you find in the fridge or cabinets, you may consume. 


### Appliances
There is no vent in the kitchen, open windows when cooking anything that gets smokey. Fire alarm scares the dogs :laughing:

You may use any appliance that we have for your survival. Please treat it all as if it were your own. 

#### Dishwasher
The dishwasher is used often in our house. Look for the ` clean | dirty ` magnet opposite the dishwasher to know if the dishes are supposedly clean or dirty.

:::caution 
Do not put the non-stick pots/pans in the dishwasher
