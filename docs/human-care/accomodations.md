<summary>Record Player <i class="fa-solid fa-record-vinyl"></i></summary>

The record player should have some record in it right now. To listen to a record, the TV must be off. Just press the `play` button and it will work. Other records are available in the cabinet door nearby. The Selena record has a scratch that causes it to skip a bit sometimes. The other records are all functional.
    Please use the buttons to operate the player if you aren't used to using a record player already.
