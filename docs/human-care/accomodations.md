# Accomodations

We hope you are comfortable in our home. We are thankful for you taking care of our pets and our spaces. 


## The guest bedroom 

The bedroom at the end of the hallway is typically setup for you. The bed is a folding couch, layed out flat for sleeping. 
- Additional sheets are under the bed. 
- Additional blankets are in the closet.

If you are confident in playing instruments, you are welcome to play with the guitars hanging on the wall.

## The living room

### Couch <i class="fa-solid fa-couch"></i>



The couch is also a pull out bed in the case that you want to sleep in the living room. Its a bit noisier, but maybe a bit softer than the guest room's bed. The dogs spend most of the day in the living room, looking out the window or sleeping.

The dogs can be on the couch :thumbsup: 

The couch cover should be on the couch as well. It needs to be adjusted a lot when the dogs are active. Just try to keep as much of the couch covered as possible with the couch cover.

<summary>Record Player <i class="fa-solid fa-record-vinyl"></i></summary>

The record player should have some record in it right now. To listen to a record, the TV must be off. Just press the `play` button and it will work. Other records are available in the cabinet door nearby. The Selena record has a scratch that causes it to skip a bit sometimes. The other records are all functional.
    Please use the buttons to operate the player if you aren't used to using a record player already.

<summary>Desks</summary>

Feel free to make space on the desks for you own activities. The desktop keyboard can be pushed back for a good amount of space for a laptop. You might even find some loose cables that would allow you to utilize the additional monitors at the desk, which is ok to do.
