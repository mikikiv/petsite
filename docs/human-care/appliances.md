# Kitchen

## Kitchen Appliances
You may use any appliance that we have for your survival. Please treat it all as if it were your own. 

### Whats in the fridge
Honestly, probably not much. With the sole exception of the last servings of cereal and milk, whatever you find in the fridge or cabinets, you may consume. If you find beer, please feel free to help us drink it

Theres a water/ice dispenser on the front of the fridge. 

### Dishwasher
The dishwasher is used often in our house. Look for the ` clean | dirty ` magnet to know if the dishes are supposedly clean or dirty.
Sometimes, white dishes come out with little brown spots; I think its like rusty water spots; haven't figured that out yet, but the spots can be wiped with a paper townl

## Laundry Room

Scouties litter box lives here for now. 
### Washer Mashine
Works like how you'd expect most of the time. Nothing special here...

### Dryer
Super noisey sometimes. It's ok. 
Empty the lint thing like you would on any other dryer please

### Bathroom #2
This bathroom is currently not working as expected. The toilet has an internal leak; its ok to use, but we prefer to leave this room as off limits as much as possible. The run in there now is recovering from pet accidents.
