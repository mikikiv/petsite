# Kitchen

## Kitchen Appliances
You may use any appliance that we have for your survival. Please treat it all as if it were your own. 

### Whats in the fridge
Honestly, probably not much. With the sole exception of the last servings of cereal and milk, whatever you find in the fridge or cabinets, you may consume. If you find beer, please feel free to help us drink it

Theres a water/ice dispenser on the front of the fridge. 

### Dishwasher
The dishwasher is used often in our house. Look for the ` clean | dirty ` magnet to know if the dishes are supposedly clean or dirty. Soap for the dishwasher is in one of the cabinets near it.

## Laundry Room

### Washer Mashine
Works like how you'd expect most of the time. Nothing special here...

### Dryer
Super noisey sometimes. It's ok. 
Empty the lint thing like you would on any other dryer please

### Bathroom #2
Yep, its a bathroom. Feel free to use it
