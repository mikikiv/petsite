# Technology

We have all sorts of stuff connected to internet in the house!

## Internet / Wifi

<div style = {{margin:'0 auto', width:'max-content'}}>Scan for wifi</div>

[![Connect to the wifi](@site/static/img/wifi.svg?width=300px&height=300px)](wifi://:cjtetonscout16@networknotfound)

</span>
There are computers in the house, but they are off-limits and password protected.

Feel free to clear some desk space for yourself if you need!

## Alexa

Amazon Alexa controls the main lights in the living room. She also is able to set alarms, play music, and tell jokes. Take advantage of its convenience!

There are 4 devices in the house:
- Living room
- Kitchen
- Guest bedroom
- Master bedroom

:::note Common commands

- Alexa, turn on the lights. 
- Alexa, goodnight.
- Alexa, play music around the house.
- Alexa, set an alarm for 8am.

## TV

Our TV is hooked up to nearly all the streaming services via the FireTV stick. You only need one remote to control everything you need (unless you start needing to access different inputs, in that case the tv remote is in the drawer below the tv).
There are several apps built into the FireTV in the living room. 
For each service, use the profile Mikey if available, and then Mikayler or TayMik, or Tayler, whichever is available first. See 

* AmazonPrime
* Netflix
* Hulu (no ads!)
* Disney+
* HBO Max

:::tip Accounts 

These accounts are a mix of our own and friends and families :laughing:  
Feel free to watch whatever you want, just don't create or delete any profiles :thumbsup:

Aim to use Mikey's and Tayler's profile when available
