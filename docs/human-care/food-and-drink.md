# Accomodations

We hope you are comfortable in our home. We are thankful for you taking care of our pets and our spaces. 

## Sleeping

The bedroom a the end of the hallway is typically setup for you. The bed is a folding couch, layed out flat for sleeping.

- Additional blankets are in the closet.

If you are confident in playing instruments, you are welcome to play with the guitars hanging on the wall.
