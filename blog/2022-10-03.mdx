Tayler and Mikey go to the East Coast for a wedding and visit NYC.

Lately, Cj and Olympia have been having to go poop more often than usual, and CJ is taking longer than usual. We switched over their food to a new brand and they are not adjusting too well. They love the food but obviously this poop thing isn't great.
Consider adding some pumkpin from the can to one of their meals.
