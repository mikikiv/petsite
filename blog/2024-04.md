CJ was pretty consistently having wet bowel movements so we switched him off of the kibble diet in favor of fresh foods. We originally were cooking chicken and rice for him regularly but that got very tedious so we switched over to a refrigerated food called PetFresh. Both of these solutions resolved the wet poop (we briefly tried to go back to processed foods but it didn't go well. )

The latest transition has him on a more raw diet; this contains chicken, oatmeal, and some other veggies. We have to mix water into this food which I think will help with his unquenchable thirst!
